# DH-Statsbot
Version 1.5.0

DH-Statsbot is my project to provide a simple-to-use and quick text interface that mirrors the statistics as seen on the official Darkest Hour stats website.

Typically every couple months I try to add a new feature to statsbot. As of now, October of 2020, statsbot has the following functional features:

* Personal statistic display (Kills, deaths, teamkills, kd/r, etc.)
* Server-pop display
* Individual map statistic display 
  * (Total deaths on a given map across all rounds, which side is "winning" overall between axis & allied powers on each map.)

* Overall "war-progress" display 
  * (Displays the total number of deaths that have occured and are recorded on the stats website, which faction is currently "winning.")

The current external modules used are:
* Discord.py
* BeautifulSoup
* Tabulate

Statsbot was my first real programming project. As a result, the quality of my code is all over the place, mainly in the gutter for 99% of it. I have thought about rewriting the entirety of statsbot in a different language like Rust, or just tearing it down and starting from scratch once again, but it works and it hasn't run into any slowdowns that I can tell as of yet, so I will continue adding to it for the time being. If you have any questions you can contact me mainly on Discord @≡Sugardust≡#8027.
